Possible Design: Time-Series Database

- Data is indexed by time which can be stored in queried. This is ideal for monitoring data.

- One Table for each API, each table would have the following fields:
 - timestamp
 - user_id	
 - response time
 - error 

- The table would be indexed by timestamp field which allows efficient querying of data.
- Additionaly, we can have another table to store aggregate data for each API,
  such as the total number of requests and errors, the average response time,
  and the error percentage.
- This new table can be updated in real-time and the queries can be answered quickly.

- To improve this design, we can use a distributed time-series database.
